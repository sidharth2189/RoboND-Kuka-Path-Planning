Run the Sample Solution
It’s time to run the project with the sample solution. Enable the GPU, GO TO DESKTOP, and follow these steps for a successful run:

Update/upgrade the system
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y```
2. Install all the packages dependencies
```sh
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
Build and source your catkin_ws
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
Launch all the project nodes
# We’ve combined all the launch files in a `start_project.sh` script. 
# Note: This script will only run if you are in the visual desktop, don't try to run it inside the workspace terminal!
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src/rll_planning_project/scripts/
./start_project.sh
You'll need to repeat these steps after each reboot!

Stopping a Run
Hit Enter key in the main terminal to instantly kill the project execution and all the ROS nodes. You need to wait at least 30 seconds before starting a new run because the nodes will take some time to fully terminate. If you encountered an error, don't worry about it - just relaunch the nodes either manually or with the shell script file provided.
