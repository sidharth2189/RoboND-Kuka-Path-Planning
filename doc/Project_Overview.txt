In this project, youâ€™ll implement a path planning algorithm by navigating a maze. In general, path planning problems through mazes are reduced to two dimensions: the x and y position of the object. However, this project will extend the search space by a third dimension, the orientation of the gripper around the vertical z-axis.

Execution Cycle
At each run, the robot will follow this cycle:

First, the KUKA gripper will move to the object start position, orient itself with respect to the object, grab the object, and lift it up.
At this stage, your path planning code will be executed. Your code will search for a path and navigate the robot through the maze by commanding 2D positions, and an orientation angle, in order to get around corners in the maze
You will have a total time of 8 minutes to search for a path and move toward the goal pose. Once reached, your cuboid object will be placed in the goal pose.
Finally, the robot will lift the object from the goal pose, return it back to the start pose, drop it, and get ready for another run.
